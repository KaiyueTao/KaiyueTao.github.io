## Query/Text-based Video Summarization via Graph Neural Network [In progress]

My graduation project, just began it. My goal is to apply GNN to the task and improve the performance on the dataset:

- [UT Egocentric](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/egocentric_data/UT_Egocentric_Dataset.html)ï¼š4 videos, each 3-5 hours, containing a diverse set of events
- [TV episodes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5824.pdf): 4 videos, each about 45 minutes long

Ultimately, I hope to design an auto movie trailer generator based on my work, which can generate different trailers from the description of the movie. I will update my progress [here](https://www.notion.so/Progress-229bc53ab075438ab460d7af5a7da19c).

## Explore MR images with limited data annotations via Metric Learning and Episodic Training

This work was done during my participation in Advanced Medical Image (AMI) Program held by Vascular Imaging Lab at the University of Washington. Recently, the work was accepted by ISMRM2021!
Please download the summarized abstract [here](/assets/Exploring%20feature%20space%20of%20MR%20vessel%20images%20with%20limited%20data%20annotations%20through%20metric%20learning%20and%20episodic%20training.pdf).

## Intelligent Video-editing Pipeline (at ByteDance)

An intelligent video-editing pipeline with powerful functions, including raw recording materials clipping, highlight extraction, audio (music) matching, action recognition and video summarization.

This work was done during my internship at ByteDance, so unfortunately the code can not be released. The pipeline combines technologies of Video Summarization, Action Recognition, OCR, Multi-modality, etc. It has proved its flexibility and power in more than 20 game trailer generation business.

## Verilog Game "Tiao-Yi-Tiao"

This is the final project of my *Syllabus of Digital Logic Lab* course. I adopted the idea from a famous wechat game called "tiaoyitiao", which is simple but addictive. I designed all the modules and structure(see the pic above), realized the basic functions in a 2D version.

Simple but fun! Check it on [github](https://github.com/KaiyueTao/tiao-yi-tiao).

Also: I'm now working as the teaching assisant of this course!

## ImageClass --- a multi-label tool for image classification datasets

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0082zybply1gc6djuouzjj31700tqwrv.jpg" />

Just wrote it with PyQt5 when I was dealing with numbers of images for my project, I found it so troublesome labeling all the images and write them into a file. So... just a simple tool for multi-labeling, I adopt the layout idea from "labelImg", a famous tool for label groundtruth objects in images.

Now it only has some basic functions to help making datasets, I'll add more functions to it in the future. Check it on [github](https://github.com/KaiyueTao/labelClass)

## 3D Model Display Platform

A platform for displaying the biological model, based on three js. Still under construction...
