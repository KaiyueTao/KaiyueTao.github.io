    <h3 style="text-align: center;">-------- About Me -------</h3>
    <p>I'm a senior student at the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC), majoring in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I'm now a member of <a href = http://kdelab.ustc.edu.cn>KDE Lab</a>, working under my advisor Professor Shouhong Wan. 
    My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and their real world applications. 
    More Specifically, I'm interested the following topics:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Unsupervised/Self-supervised Learning, Meta-learning, Few-shot Learning</li>
        <li>Multi-modality, including image, video, audio and text, etc.</li>
        <li>Graph Neural Network</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2020 I worked as an computer vision intern at ByteDance. 
        There, I mainly developed an intelligent video-editing pipeline with powerful functions, including raw recording materials clipping, highlight extraction, audio (music) matching, action recognition and video summarization.
        The pipeline has been widely used in 23+ game trailer generation businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also participated in the Advanced Medical Imaging (AMI) program in <a href="https://rad.washington.edu/research/groups/vascular-imaging-laboratory/">Vascular Imaging Lab</a> at the University of Washington, under the guidance of Prof. Chun Yuan and Dr. Li Chen. 
        I proposed a metric-learing network with episodic training method to learn the feature representation from MR images with extermely-limited labels. 
        The work was summarized into an abstract and submitted to ISMRM2021.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2019 I visited <a href="http://fais.hgc.jp/">FAiS Lab</a>. I worked on the DNA Hi-C data enhancement with Imgae Super-resolution methods.

    <p>Please find my <a href="assets/CV_KaiyueTao.pdf">CV/Resume</a> if you're interested.</p>
    <p>I'm also a big photography lover, I shot with film rolls, see my photos <a href="tabs/photography">here</a> or on <a href = https://www.instagram.com/kevinpeacher/>ins</a>. We also have a photography group could 'M250', scan the <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/qrcode_for_m250.jpg">QRcode</a> and follow us on wechat!</p>
    <p>Please feel free to reach me! I love to talk with people from various fields.</p>
